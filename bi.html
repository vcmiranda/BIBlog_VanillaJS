                <h1>What Is Business Intelligence?</h1>
                <h2>How Business Intelligence is helping midsize organizations</h2>
                <img src="images/BusinessInnovationIdeas.jpg" alt="BI"/>
                <p>Business intelligence allows organizations to better understand, monitor, analyze, and even predict what’s occurring in the overall environment and in their company. BI helps your organization turn data into useful and meaningful information and then distribute this information to those who need it, when they need it, wherever they need it, on the device of their choice – so that they can make timely and better-informed decisions. It allows organizations to combine data from a wide variety of sources and see an integrated, up-to-date, 360-degree view.</p>
                <p>This is especially important for midsize companies, which – while not having vast resources – are typically able to implement business decisions more quickly than industry giants. BI provides a win-win solution for IT and business users; it allows the IT department to be more productive in working with its business users to                 service special requests, while also permitting those business users to become more self-sufficient. Operations and analysis are two sides of the business, and BI allows IT to be a valued partner in both.</p>
                <p>Typical uses of a BI solution for a midsize company are to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify its best-selling products, and see if this holds true across all of its distribution channels</li>
                    <li>Identify customers that are cutting back on their purchases so that special inducements can be offered to retain them</li>
                    <li>Monitor social media sites, and perform sentiment analysis to gain insights into its product launches, reputation, or potential service issues</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Catalog and store current and historical reports and analyses so that they can be quickly located and analyzed in support of its collaborative decision making processes</li>
                    <li>Perform “what-if” analyses to determine how profits would be affected if sales were to increase or decrease by various percentages</li>
                    <li>Implement dashboards and scorecards so that executives and supervisors can quickly recognize operational exceptions or key performance indicators (KPIs) that fall outside of accepted ranges, and receive real-time alerts on mobile devices when this occurs so that immediate corrective action can be taken</li>
                    <li>Identify high-level trends, such as decreasing total sales, and drill down to the details to see if this is an across the-board phenomena or the result of a specific poorly performing product or greatly reduced sales in one large retail outlet</li>
                    <li>Compare year-to-date sales for this year with last year, and forecast what sales are likely to be for the entire year</li>
                    <li>Monitor a marketing campaign in real time to quickly discover if it is succeeding, and decide if it should be reinforced or cancelled in order to fund other campaigns; also determine whether a seemingly failing campaign may be succeeding in specific prospect segments</li>
                    <li>Track customer orders and desired ship dates against finished-goods inventory, and adjust the manufacturing production cycle and supply chain logistics to reduce inventory carrying costs</li>
                    <li>Integrate operational, spreadsheet, and historic data for analysis purposes – while helping to stamp out “spreadsheet chaos” – to provide consistency and “a single version of the truth” for the organization</li>
                    <li>Enable business users to perform their own ad hoc analyses without having to involve scarce IT resources</li>
                    <li>Align daily operations with strategic objectives, and quickly recognize when they are not in agreement</li>
                    <li>Replace hunches with data-driven analytical decisions</li>
                </ul>
